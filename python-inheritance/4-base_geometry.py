    A base class that provides a placeholder method for calculating the area of a geometric shape.

    This class is designed to be subclassed and extended with specific methods and attributes
    to create more specialized geometric classes.

        area(self): Raises an Exception with the message "area() is not implemented".

        Raises an Exception indicating that the area() method is not implemented in the current class.

        This method serves as a placeholder to be overridden in subclasses that provide the actual
